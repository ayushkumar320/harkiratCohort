# Authentication 
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It is a crucial aspect of security in software development, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to certain resources or functionalities.

## Types of Authentication
1. **Basic Authentication**: Involves sending a username and password with each request. It is simple but not very secure.
2. **Token-Based Authentication**: Users receive a token after logging in, which is then used for subsequent requests. This is more secure than basic authentication.
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access. This adds an extra layer of security.

## Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
- Store passwords securely using hashing algorithms.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Regularly update and patch authentication systems.

## How do you do auth checks?

1. **Identify Protected Resources**: Determine which resources or endpoints require authentication.
2. **Implement Middleware**: Use middleware to intercept requests and check for valid authentication tokens or credentials.
3. **Verify User Identity**: Validate the user's identity by checking tokens, sessions, or other credentials against a user database.
4. **Handle Unauthorized Access**: Return appropriate responses (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) for requests lacking valid authentication.

## Job of middleware in authentication
- Middlewares plays a vital role in authentication as it intercepts the request before it reaches the protected resource.
  1. **Request Interception**: Middleware can intercept incoming requests before they reach the protected resource.
  2. **Token Validation**: It can validate authentication tokens or credentials, ensuring they are present and valid.
  3. **User Context**: Middleware can attach user information to the request object, making it available to downstream handlers.
  4. **Error Handling**: It can handle authentication errors, such as expired tokens or insufficient permissions, and respond accordingly.
