# Routing
- React is a single page application
- We have single pages that are dynamically rendered based on the application's state and user interactions.
- Whenever we want to change routes, a fresh index.html renders and hard reloads the page.

# Client side bundle
- The client-side bundle is a JavaScript file that contains all the code needed to run the application in the browser.
- It is generated by a build tool like Webpack and is served to the client when they request the application.
- The bundle is typically minified and optimized for performance.

# Client side routing
- Client-side routing is the process of handling navigation within a single-page application without triggering a full page reload.
- In React, this is typically achieved using libraries like React Router.
- React Router allows us to define routes in our application and render different components based on the current URL.
