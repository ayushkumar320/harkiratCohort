# Node JS

- Node JS can be used in many ways
  1. To create CLIs (Command Line Interfaces)
  2. Create a video player
  3. Create a game
  4. Most importantly, it can be used to create web servers and APIs. We can achieve this using HTTP Server and Express.js.

## What is an HTTP Server?

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol

### Protocol
- A protocol is a set of rules that define how data is transmitted over a network.
- HTTP is an application layer protocol that facilitates communication between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers or in simple words frontend and backend.
- It defines methods for requesting and transmitting resources, such as HTML documents, images, and videos.
- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a protocol that enables real-time audio, video, and data sharing between browsers without the need for plugins.

### Frontend

- The frontend is the part of a web application that users interact with directly.
- It is responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input.
- Frontend technologies include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js.
- The frontend communicates with the backend via HTTP requests, typically using AJAX or Fetch API to retrieve and send data.


### Backend

- The backend is the part of a web application that users do not interact with directly.
- It is responsible for processing requests, managing databases, and performing server-side logic.
- Backend technologies include Node.js, Express.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, and Spring Boot.
- The backend communicates with the frontend via HTTP responses, sending data back to the client in formats like JSON or XML.
- Backend code is never exposed to the client.
- Example: Machine Learning Model of ChatGPT happens on their own server and we only get to see the response it generated to our queries.

### Note
  - The protocol which is used to send response from backend to frontend is generally HTTP.
